      <h1>About the Owner</h1>

      <p>
        Yuko Watanabe is the founder of Yuko Kitchen. Aspiring to become a pastry chef after years of training in Japan, Yuko came to America where she worked as sushi chef before opening Yuko Kitchen in a small Hollywood apartment many years later. She notes that her journey as a chef and opening the restaurant are part of her experience with the American dream as she faced many struggles in her early years in the country and as a female chef.

        When not busy with the restaurant, Yuko enjoys expressing her creativity through various crafts and taking care of her dog.

        As for the establishment itself, Yuko has filled her restaurant, which was once an old dance studio, with beautiful flora that makes the restaurant a sight to see within the city. Something else that makes the place so unique is its extensive and carefully-curated menu. Noting that people may want something sweet after their meal, Yuko has worked on developing recipes for unique cookies and cakes which offer a refreshing taste to a filling meal. Creativity has no limits to Yuko, which can be seen all throughout her establishment.
